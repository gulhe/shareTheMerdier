Feature: Scoring system
  As a Yams player
  I want to be able to tell hom many points I did for a given combination
  In order to update the score board when there will be one

  NOTE : This should be a persona later ...

  Scenario Outline: If <combination> is rolled the <score> is scored
    Given a <combination> is scored
    Then it accounts for <score> points

    Examples:
      | combination  | score |
      | simple       | 1     |
      | paire        | 3     |
      | double-paire | 4     |
      | brelan       | 5     |
      | suite        | 7     |
      | full         | 8     |
      | carr√©        | 10    |
      | Yam          | 20    |
